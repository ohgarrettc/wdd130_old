    <h2>Garrett Curley</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Garrett, I am originally from Gallup, New Mexico but have lived for the past 11 years in North Carolina. My major is in applied technology with a focus on Computer Programming and Information Systems. I have done IT work for the past 5 years but felt like it was time to go back to school. It was way too easy to fall into IT support after receiving my Associates. I originally got into tech because of the desire to learn coding.</p>
    <p2>Some things about me; I love films! Like love films. Way more than I should. I personally feel that tacos are the best food on planet earth, one talent I have is I can play the ukulele, and the best thing about BYUI is pathway worldwide. Seriously, how did I not hear of remote learning to complete a bachelor's degree before 2 years ago?
